<h1 align='center'> Cybersecurity Threats and Vulnerabilities Exploration (Data Analysis and Machine Learning) </h1>

## Overview
In this self-initiated project, I immerse myself in the realm of cybersecurity threats, utilizing data science skills to analyze and understand recent cybersecurity challenges. Inspired by my background in cybersecurity, interest in machine learning and classification model building.

### Project Significance
Cybersecurity Definition: Safeguarding critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks (IBM, 2022).

Risks Involved: Cyber threats, ranging from malware to DDoS attacks, pose significant risks, including financial loss, privacy breaches, and service disruptions.

### Investigation Initiation
I start by identifying recent cybersecurity threats, focusing on two primary systems:

1. Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) System
Purpose: Catalogs publicly known vulnerabilities in software.
Maintained By: The MITRE Corporation.
Complemented By: National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
2. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) System
Purpose: Categorizes types of software vulnerabilities based on characteristics.
Developed By: MITRE.
Categories: Software development, hardware design, and research concepts.
3. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
Purpose: Assesses the impact of vulnerabilities identified in the CVE system.
Developed By: National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Key Role: Quantifies the severity of vulnerabilities.
Dataset Utilization
I leverage a dataset derived from CVSS data for the year 2020, sourced from the National Vulnerability Database. Focused on the Software Development viewpoint, the dataset includes unique CVEs mapped to one or more CWEs, each assigned a vulnerability score by the CVSS system.

### Exploration and Analysis
With this dataset, I aim to tackle questions and challenges related to cybersecurity threats. Armed with Python, data analysis skills, and a basic understanding of machine learning, I plan to employ exploratory analysis and potentially develop models to contribute meaningfully to the field.

### This self-project aligns with my professional expertise and showcases a proactive approach to skill development and problem-solving in the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity.
